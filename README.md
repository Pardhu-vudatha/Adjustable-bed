# Adjustable-bed
Hospital bed project
Bedsore is one of the most dreadful and expensive disease for partially or completely paralyzed people. These is no proper cure for bedsore and thus prevention is the only practical option. Bedsore or pressure ulcers as they are commonly referred are caused as bedridden people are unable to move their body by them self. A common man keeps changing his body posture in regular interval of time even in his sleep thus preventing pressure ulcers. The project aims to develop an adjustable bed (150 kg payload) for prevention of bedsore among partially or fully paralyzed people. The bed can move the patient to different position in a specific interval of time to reduce the pressure concentration on the specific parts of the patient, reducing the bedsore and ease the labour work of caretaker. The bed has four DOF and length of the bed can be adjusted for people with different heights. The bed can change its position in both sagittal and frontal plane . The position of the bed can be controlled using a remote. Also person with motor neuron disease can control it with their eye movement. The bed can be also set to automatic mode which changes the patient’s body to different postures at regular interval of time. This helps to shift the pressure on the body to different place to prevent pressure ulcers.
Unique feature of your innovation :
The Unique feature of the adjustable bed are as follows:
* capability to adjust to 4 different positions namely the torso, leg and both the sideways. can be easily assembled and dismantled for the ease of transportation.
* The position of revolute joints can be adjusted as per the patient’s height.
*Low power consumption as the lead screw mechanisms are self locking.
*Bed can be set to automatically change the body posture based on definite time intervals during sleep time.
*The bed can be controlled by a remote for the patient or caretaker.
